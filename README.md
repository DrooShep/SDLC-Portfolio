How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?

I interpret user needs by requests made by the customer and figure out the code in which to implement them. Creating user stories allows me to see the requests made by customer/users and they help me prioritize the requests.

How do I approach developing programs? What agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?

I hope to incorporate user stories to develop projects. I also hope to incorporate scrum boards with my team to be able to make the project completion a lot easier and smoother.

What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?

To be a good team member in software development I believe that you need to be patient with your other team members. Helping where you can and teaching new developers things that maybe thay have not seen before. Working well as a team will help the completion of projects easier and the quality of your work will be better if the moral of every team member is better.
